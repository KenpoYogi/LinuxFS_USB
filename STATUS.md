# Linux USB Mounter — where we are (status trail)

> **▶ THE LIVE "START HERE" RESUME IS [RESUME.md](RESUME.md)** (small, rewritten each change). This file is the
> **append-only trail**: one entry per commit (or per uncommitted change, until it is committed), newest first, each
> naming what changed and the evidence behind it. **Prepend; never rewrite or truncate.** An entry goes in with
> its own commit, so it cannot name its own hash: the next change adds it (`(this commit)` → the hash). Detailed technical findings stay in
> [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); logs are in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BtrfsUsbMounter\mounter.log`.

## ⭐ (this commit) — **CLAUDE.md: KALI-LINUX TEST DISTRO GONE, TUMBLEWEED IS THE ONLY DISTRO.** _2026-10-04. Evidence: user unregistered kali-linux (openSUSE for day-to-day work); `wsl --list --verbose` shows only openSUSE-Tumbleweed (default, WSL2). Docs only, no build._

- **CLAUDE.md, Environment:** one distro (openSUSE-Tumbleweed, 6.18 drivers built); the Kali results stay as history,
  re-testing the apt build path needs a new distro.

---

## ⭐ `09ea09b` — **MAIN WINDOW TITLE SHOWS THE VERSION: "Linux USB Mounter (2.2.1)".** _2026-09-28. Evidence: user request ("put the build version in parenthesis in the dialogue title bar, to the right of the \"Linux USB Miunter\" text"). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors. NOT seen on screen (the app needs elevation)._

- **MainForm.BuildUi:** title = UiKit.AppName + " (" + assembly version, 3 parts + ")". Message boxes, tray tooltip and the log
  keep the plain name; the version number stays 2.2.1.

---

## ⭐ `3930751` — **2.2.1: REISERFS AND REISER4 REMOVED FROM THE CODE.** _2026-09-28. Evidence: user request ("ReiserFS and Reiser4 are still mentioned in the code. Can you remove these references since they are no longer supported? Increment release to 2.2.1."). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors, LinuxUsbMounter-2.2.1-Setup.exe / -Portable.zip. Reflection on the built exe: FsKind = Btrfs,Ext2,Ext3,Ext4,Xfs,Jfs,Zfs,HfsPlus,Apfs,Ufs; a buffer with ReIsEr2Fs at 64 KiB + 52 gives 0 signatures; assembly version 2.2.1.0. `sh -n` on the build script OK. NOT run: the script in WSL (the removed lines were no-ops on 6.18: no fs/reiserfs, no REISERFS_FS symbol)._

- **FileSystems.cs:** FsKind.ReiserFs / Reiser4, their names, the two probes, the NoDriverHint texts, the Buildable and
  KernelKinds entries. A ReiserFS partition now shows as an unrecognised filesystem.
- **build-wsl-modules.sh:** the reiserfs argument and default, the REISERFS_FS config options, the pre-6.13 skip branch.
- **Version 2.2.1:** csproj, app.manifest, installer/setup.manifest. CLAUDE.md: the "probe stays in the code" rule replaced.

---

## ⭐ `941a29d` — **README: NO MORE "POWERSHELL VERSION" MENTIONS.** _2026-09-28. Evidence: user said "yes please" to removing / rewording the two remaining mentions. Docs only, no build._

- **Intro:** "A compiled port of the PowerShell tool: mount ..." is now "Mount ...".
- **Removed:** the "same `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BtrfsUsbMounter` folder as the PowerShell version" bullet (the Install section
  names the folder). PowerShell now appears only as the shell (build command, command line).

---

## ⭐ `b3b1aee` — **README: "WHAT CHANGED COMPARED TO THE POWERSHELL VERSION" REMOVED.** _2026-09-28. Evidence: user request ("Also remove \"What changed compared to the PowerShell version\" section from the README"). Docs only, no build._

- **Removed:** the comparison table and the "Behaviour is otherwise identical" paragraph (nothing linked to them).

---

## ⭐ `54ef01f` — **README: MIGRATION / UPGRADE SECTIONS REMOVED; PORTABLE = SET UP LINUX YOURSELF.** _2026-09-28. Evidence: user request ("remove the \"Migrating from the PowerShell version\" section and the \"Upgrading from BtrfsUsbMounter.exe or XnixUsbMounter.exe\" section from the README"; "make it clear that if the \"Portable\" version is installed, the user must do a manual install and setup of the linux distros in WSL"). Docs only, no build._

- **Removed:** the two README sections (nothing linked to them).
- **Portable:** intro bullet, a new Install table row (Linux check: installer yes, portable no + guides link) and a note at
  the top of the Portable section: install WSL2, a distro and btrfs-progs / util-linux / kmod by hand (docs/distros).

---

## ⭐ `0de4a65` — **2.2.0: THE UNINSTALLER OFFERS TO REMOVE THE WSL DISTRO SETUP INSTALLED.** _2026-09-26. Evidence: user request ("If the installer did the WSL linux install, during uninstall ask the user (maybe check boxes) if they want to uninstall the Windows App Only or both the Windows App and the WSL Linux instance. Increment the version to 2.2.0"). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors, LinuxUsbMounter-2.2.0-Setup.exe / -Portable.zip. Non-elevated tests by reflection: UninstallForm with recorded distros [kali-linux, Gone-Distro] rendered "What to remove" with the Windows app (ticked, disabled) and one unticked box for kali-linux only; InstallDistro(Ubuntu-26.04) then the new RemoveDistro: listed, then gone from `wsl --list` (Tumbleweed and Kali untouched); SetupDistros() on the real 2.0.0 key: 0 entries. NOT run: AddSetupDistro (HKLM write needs elevation), a full elevated uninstall that removes a distro._

- **Record:** after `wsl --install` succeeds, `Installation.AddSetupDistro` adds `<user SID>\t<name>` to
  `LumSetupDistros` (REG_MULTI_SZ) in the Uninstall key; updates keep it.
- **Uninstall window:** "What to remove" when a recorded distro of this user still exists: the Windows app (always) and
  one checkbox per distro, unticked by default, with a "deletes it and every file inside it; can't be undone" note; the
  confirmation names the distro.
- **Uninstaller.Run:** new step 2b after the unmount: `wsl --unregister` for each ticked distro; kept (with the reason
  in the log) if drives are still mounted or another copy of the program runs elsewhere; a failure is logged, the
  uninstall goes on. WSL itself and distros the user installed are never removed.
- **Version 2.2.0** (csproj, app.manifest, setup.manifest). **Docs:** README (Linux check note, Uninstall step 3),
  CLAUDE.md.
- **Files.** `installer/Setup.cs`, `installer/setup.manifest`, `app.manifest`, `LinuxUsbMounter.csproj`, `README.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `RESUME.md`, this file.

## `c676eba` — **2.1.0: SETUP CHECKS WSL2 / LINUX AND OFFERS TO SET IT UP (openSUSE TUMBLEWEED, UBUNTU 26.04, KALI).** _2026-09-26. Evidence: user request ("check for a properly configured Linux in WSL2 and if it is not there, prompt user to either manually install first (point to distro docs), OR have them select either openSUSE-Tumbleweed, Ubuntu, or Kali Linux for installation with all necessary packages. Increment the version to 2.1.0"; then "openSUSE is still the default. The Ubuntu choice will install 26.04"). `wsl --list --online` on the dev PC: names Ubuntu-26.04, openSUSE-Tumbleweed, kali-linux. `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors, LinuxUsbMounter-2.1.0-Setup.exe / -Portable.zip. Against real WSL 2.7.14 (non-elevated, loading the setup exe by reflection): Check found Tumbleweed ready in 3.8 s; Kali with btrfs-progs removed → reported missing and fixable, InstallPackages reinstalled only btrfs-progs; fresh Ubuntu-26.04 via InstallDistro + InstallPackages(fresh): registered with --no-launch in 15 s as WSL2, 93 packages upgraded + btrfs-progs, default user root, ready, 52 s, then unregistered; zypper package step on Tumbleweed (first version installed present packages and so upgraded util-linux 2.42.2 → 2.42.3; changed to missing-only, re-run: "already has" and nothing done). Dialog rendered for no-WSL, no-distro and fixable+WSL1. Also found: the user's real 2.0.0 install in C:\Apps\Linux_USB is correct (Installed apps entry without Publisher, 7 files, Start menu .lnk, logon task). NOT run: WSL install (restart) and `wsl --update` paths, fresh Tumbleweed / Kali, dnf / pacman, the 2.1.0 setup elevated._

- **installer/Setup.cs:** `WslRunner` (wsl.exe with WSL_UTF8=1, time limit, streamed lines minus progress bars),
  `LinuxSetup` (Check, InstallWsl, UpdateWsl, InstallDistro, InstallPackages, SetDefault), `LinuxSetupDialog`, and the
  Linux step in InstallForm after the files are copied (checkbox, on by default; a pending restart skips starting the
  program). Uninstall's closing line says WSL distros are left in place (`wsl --unregister`).
- **Version 2.1.0:** csproj `<Version>`, app.manifest and setup.manifest assemblyIdentity.
- **Docs:** README Installer section (Linux check and its choices), docs/distros/README.md (let the installer do it),
  a Shortcut tip in the Tumbleweed / Ubuntu (setup installs 26.04) / Kali guides, CLAUDE.md (design + verification).
- **Files.** `installer/Setup.cs`, `installer/setup.manifest`, `app.manifest`, `LinuxUsbMounter.csproj`, `README.md`,
  `docs/distros/README.md`, `docs/distros/opensuse-tumbleweed.md`, `docs/distros/ubuntu.md`, `docs/distros/kali.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `RESUME.md`, this file.

---

## `5e0028c` — **v2 ICON FILES DELETED.** _2026-09-26. Evidence: user request ("delete the v2 files, commit and sync"). `assets/LinuxUsbMount_v2.ico` and `assets/LinuxUsbMount_2048_v2.png` (the Google-sourced badge, unknown rights) were never committed; deleted from disk, so `assets/` holds v1 (unused) and v3 (in use). Only this file and RESUME.md change._

---

## `a9020bf` — **INSTALLER / UNINSTALLER (LinuxUsbMounter-<version>-Setup.exe) AND A PORTABLE ZIP.** _2026-09-26. Evidence: user requests ("a small windows installer/uninstaller ... install (to any desired location) ... easily uninstall ... stop the application/unmount drives if necessary but warn the user. The default location will be C:\Program Files\Linux_USB"; "update all relevant documentation"; "make sure the user understands they can either run the installer OR copy the files manually (a Portable version)"). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors; bin\Release has LinuxUsbMounter-2.0.0-Setup.exe (2.1 MB) and -Portable.zip (the 6 program files). Tested in a NON-elevated session by loading the setup exe through reflection: install-path checks (Program Files root, drive root, Windows, profile, Desktop, relative, empty rejected), payload extract (all 6 files byte-identical to bin\Release\net48, Uninstall.exe identical to the setup), .lnk target / icon / working folder, removal deletes only its files and keeps a user file + folder, state.json read, logon task query (found the user's C:\Apps\Linux_USB copy), both windows rendered with DrawToBitmap. Process finder + 15 s Kill fallback on a renamed ping.exe (also as BtrfsUsbMounter.exe); quit message on a hidden WinForms stand-in: closed in 0.1 s, exit 0. NOT run: a real elevated install / update / uninstall, the real app handling the quit message, `--unmount-all` through a pipe._

- **installer/Setup.cs** (+ `setup.manifest`): one WinForms exe, compiled by the new BuildSetup target like the .com;
  the program files are `payload/...` resources (csproj `SetupPayload`). Install to any folder (default
  `%ProgramFiles%\Linux_USB`), all-users Start menu / desktop shortcuts, optional system PATH, Installed apps entry,
  copies itself as `Uninstall.exe`; update in place or move (old folder removed, logon task re-pointed); closes a
  running copy (quit message, 15 s, Kill) and, if the user agrees, copies running from other folders.
- **Uninstall:** re-runs from %TEMP%; warns when the app runs or drives are mounted; closes it; `--unmount-all` through a
  pipe (not while another copy runs elsewhere); asks before going on with drives still mounted; removes logon task
  (if it starts this copy), shortcuts, PATH, registry, its own files (user files and then the folder stay); settings
  folder only if ticked.
- **App:** `LinuxUsbMounter.Quit` window message (MainForm exits without prompts, cancels the running job, drives stay
  mounted); CLI writes to a redirected stdout (pipe / file) instead of opening a console that waits for Enter.
- **Portable:** BuildPortableZip target zips the net48 folder.
- **Icon v3 + no name in Installed apps** (user requests: "take my name off of the uninstaller entry"; "rebuild
  everything to use the icon LinuxUsbMount_v3.ico ... It is Tux only. Give credit where necessary"): `ApplicationIcon`
  → `assets\LinuxUsbMount_v3.ico` (user-supplied: the drive with classic Tux on a green badge; 10 frames 16-256, 32-bit
  DIB) + `LinuxUsbMount_2048_v3.png`. exe, .com and setup embed it pixel-exact (32 px compared); the exe inside the setup
  and the zip is the rebuilt one (SHA-256). v2 (a badge found through a Google search with Tux, the BSD daemon and Duke:
  unknown rights) was dropped before it was ever committed; its files stay untracked in `assets/`. The uninstall entry
  no longer writes `Publisher` (and deletes an old one); the setup has no AssemblyCompany; the copyright notice stays
  (license). README License section: credits for Tux (Larry Ewing, The GIMP) and the Linux trademark line. The v1
  `LinuxUsbMount.ico` / `_2048.png` are still in `assets/`, unused.
- **Docs:** README (intro, Build, Install with an installer-vs-portable table, Installer, Uninstall, Portable,
  PowerShell / old-name upgrades, Command line, Project layout, Troubleshooting); step 1 and troubleshooting in all 9
  docs/distros guides; CLAUDE.md (Commands, Architecture, installer verification).
- **Files.** `installer/Setup.cs`, `installer/setup.manifest`, `LinuxUsbMounter.csproj`, `src/Program.cs`,
  `src/UI/MainForm.cs`, `README.md`, `docs/distros/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `RESUME.md`, this file.

## `72f1f60` — **NEW APP ICON: assets/LinuxUsbMount.ico REPLACES THE OLD BTRFS "b" app.ico.** _2026-09-26. Evidence: user request ("I put an Icon LinuxUsbMount.ico created in another Claude session in the assets folder. Please use this icon"). The .ico is well formed: 10 frames 16/20/24/32/40/48/64/96/128/256, all 32-bit DIB, all inside the file; every frame previewed on light and dark backgrounds. `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors. Embedded 32 px icon of LinuxUsbMounter.exe and of the .com (read through a renamed copy: the shell won't extract icons from a .com) matches the .ico pixel for pixel. Not seen in the running app's tray / title bar (needs an elevated launch)._

- **Icon:** dark drive with a blue USB trident, amber activity light, USB plug on top, green folder-tree badge ("filesystem
  attached"). `LinuxUsbMount_2048.png` is the same art at 2048 x 2048.
- **csproj:** `ApplicationIcon` → `assets\LinuxUsbMount.ico` (the `.com` launcher's `Win32Icon` follows `$(ApplicationIcon)`);
  both asset files listed as `None` items. `assets/app.ico` deleted. `UiKit.AppIcon` reads the exe's icon, so no code change.
- **Dropped:** a script-drawn Tux icon (`tools/make-icon.ps1`, never committed) made earlier the same session.
- **Files.** `LinuxUsbMounter.csproj`, `assets/LinuxUsbMount.ico`, `assets/LinuxUsbMount_2048.png`, `assets/app.ico` (deleted),
  `README.md` (project layout), `RESUME.md`, this file.

## `57cc60c` — **NO WSL VM BOOT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO MOUNT (FANS SPIKED WITH THE APP AT 0% CPU).** _2026-09-25. Evidence: user report ("cpu usage is 0% in task manager, the system cpu and gpu fan speeds spike"). mounter.log session 08:29-08:31: the only heavy step was the first scan's filesystem support check (`wsl -d openSUSE-Tumbleweed ... sh -c`, 4,036 ms = VM boot) although the only USB disk (Sabrent SSD) had no supported filesystem. Measured with hypervisor counters: cold VM start ~1.6 + 1.2 guest cores and ~16 % of 32 host threads for 2-3 s; idle VM (and keep-alive) 0 guest CPU, host CPU unchanged, no GPU use by msrdc / vmmemWSL; MSFT_Disk query ~35 ms; UI timers trivial; btrfsmaintenance timers only cover / (ext4). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors. Not run in the GUI._

- **MainForm.RequestScan:** scan first, then `FsSupport.EnsureAsync` only if a volume is mountable (not mounted, not
  unplugged); otherwise a debug line "Filesystem support check skipped". Cache clear / sync order unchanged.
- **CLI (`Program.cs`):** same condition for `--list` / `--mount-all`.
- A mount still checks support itself (`MountManager`), so a drive plugged in later works as before.
- **Not changed:** keep-alive while mounted (idle VM costs nothing); WSLg (`msrdc`) is a user setting
  (`guiApplications=false` in .wslconfig), not app code. CLAUDE.md "Don't boot the WSL VM needlessly" has the numbers.
- **Files.** `src/UI/MainForm.cs`, `src/Program.cs`, `CLAUDE.md`, `RESUME.md`, this file.

## `e2b0d11` — **RENAMED AGAIN: XNIX USB MOUNTER → LINUX USB MOUNTER, OUTPUT FILES LinuxUsbMounter.exe / .exe.config / .com.** _2026-09-25. Evidence: user request ("from XnixUsbMounter to LinuxUsbMounter to be a bit more descriptive ... all the code and documentation changes"). Clean `obj`, `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors; bin\Release
et48 has LinuxUsbMounter.exe / .exe.config / .com / .pdb, ProductName "Linux USB Mounter", OriginalFilename LinuxUsbMounter.exe. `git grep -i xnix` outside the status docs: only the README upgrade note and CLAUDE.md "Name". Not run (elevated GUI)._

- **Renamed** everything `29f15c5` renamed: `XnixUsbMounter.csproj` → `LinuxUsbMounter.csproj` (git mv), assembly, namespaces,
  display name, file headers, LICENSE, app.manifest, launcher, .vscode, build script comments, README, distro guides, CLAUDE.md.
- **Still the old BtrfsUsbMounter name on purpose** (unchanged): data folder, mutex / ack event / ShowWindow message,
  logon task, the `.ps1` check. Nothing kept the Xnix name.
- README upgrade section now covers `BtrfsUsbMounter.*` and `XnixUsbMounter.*`. STATUS.md history left as written, title only.
- **Files.** all of the above, `RESUME.md`, this file.

---

## `159c44d` — **REISERFS AND REISER4 REMOVED FROM ALL USER DOCUMENTATION.** _2026-09-25. Evidence: user request ("Since Reiser4 and ReiserFS cannot be mounted, remove all mention of them from all documentation"). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors. `git grep -i reiser` outside the status docs and CLAUDE.md: only src/Core/FileSystems.cs and tools/build-wsl-modules.sh (code). Not run in the GUI._

- **README:** both table rows, the "(before Linux 6.13) ReiserFS" in the build steps, "Reiser" in the file list.
- **docs/distros:** the ReiserFS / Reiser4 row in all 9 guides, the paragraph in docs/distros/README.md.
- **User-facing texts:** `--help` (`src/Program.cs`, now "... JFS, ZFS, HFS+, APFS, UFS/UFS2"), the Tools menu item and the
  build confirmation dialog (`src/UI/MainForm.cs`).
- **Unchanged (code):** the probe still detects both and explains why they can't be mounted; the build script still
  builds reiserfs on pre-6.13 kernels. CLAUDE.md "Filesystems" records the decision.
- **Files.** `README.md`, `docs/distros/*.md` (10), `src/Program.cs`, `src/UI/MainForm.cs`, `CLAUDE.md`, `RESUME.md`, this file.

---

## `29f15c5` — **RENAMED TO XNIX USB MOUNTER: OUTPUT FILES XnixUsbMounter.exe / .exe.config / .com.** _2026-09-25. Evidence: user request ("make the name of the output files from BtrfsUsbMounter to XnixUsbMounter ... all the code and documentation changes"). Clean `obj`, `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings, 0 errors; bin\Release
et48 has XnixUsbMounter.exe / .exe.config / .com / .pdb, exe ProductName "Xnix USB Mounter", OriginalFilename XnixUsbMounter.exe. Not run (elevated GUI)._

- **Renamed:** `BtrfsUsbMounter.csproj` → `XnixUsbMounter.csproj` (git mv), AssemblyName / RootNamespace / every namespace,
  Product and every "Btrfs USB Mounter" display string (window title, --help, log start line, task description, SPDX
  headers, LICENSE "Software:" line, build script comments), app.manifest identity, launcher target exe, .vscode tasks.
- **Kept on purpose** (older copies must still see the new one): `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BtrfsUsbMounter` (state + log carry
  over), mutex / ack event / ShowWindow message `BtrfsUsbMounter.*`, logon task name `BtrfsUsbMounter` (re-pointed to the
  new exe by `PointsElsewhere`), the `BtrfsUsbMounter.ps1` check. Commented in code; listed in CLAUDE.md "Name".
- **Docs:** README (names, install folder, new "Upgrading from BtrfsUsbMounter.exe"), all distro guides, CLAUDE.md.
  STATUS.md history left as written (append-only), title only.
- **Files.** all of the above, `RESUME.md`, this file.

---

## `a874ec1` — **EMPTY DRIVE LIST TEXT: REISERFS AND REISER4 REMOVED, "UFS" → "UFS/UFS2".** _2026-09-25. Evidence: user request ("In the dialogue background remove the words ReiserFS and Reiser4 please. Also change UFS to UFS/UFS2"). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 errors. Not run in the GUI._

- `MainForm.emptyLabel` now reads "...btrfs, ext2/3/4, XFS, JFS, ZFS, HFS+, APFS or UFS/UFS2 - it will appear here
  automatically." Detection unchanged. `--help` (`src/Program.cs`) still lists ReiserFS and Reiser4 (asked the user).
- **Files.** `src/UI/MainForm.cs`, `RESUME.md`, this file.

## `238c76f` — **UFS1 / UFS2 (FREEBSD, NETBSD, OPENBSD): DETECTED, MOUNTED READ-ONLY, READ/WRITE OPT-IN WITH A PATCHED DRIVER THAT FREEBSD ACCEPTS.** _2026-09-25. Evidence: user request ("add UFS and UFS2 support", then "read/write if possible, and update all the distro docs"). Driver built on 6.18.33.2 in Tumbleweed and Kali (CRCs match, 7 modules load, `wsl_handoff=1`); patch applies and compiles on the 6.6 tree too. **FreeBSD 15.1 in QEMU/KVM inside WSL:** `newfs -U -j` UFS2 (SU+J + check hashes) and `newfs -O1 -U` UFS1 → Linux ro and rw writes → FreeBSD `fsck_ffs -n` clean, 3161 / 3160 checksums match, FreeBSD writes after, clean; crash copy (taken while rw-mounted) refused rw by FreeBSD, `fsck -p` skips the stale journal and does a full check. Kali: NetBSD `makefs` UFS1 written (incl. ENOSPC) → FreeBSD fsck clean, 1386 checksums match. Probe run on 8 real superblocks (FreeBSD, makefs, crafted unclean). `dotnet build -c Release`: 0 warnings. **The app itself has not mounted a UFS disk** (wsl --mount needs an elevated shell)._

- **Probe** (`FsProbe.Ufs`): UFS2 at 64 KiB, UFS1 (or makefs UFS2, not mountable, noted) at 8 KiB, either byte order;
  label (fs_volname, new layout only), UUID as blkid (`%08x%08x` of fs_id), size and free space; picks `ufstype`
  (ufs2, 44bsd; sun / sunx86 by the Solaris state stamp, read-only). fs_clean != 1, FS_NEEDSFSCK, gjournal → read-only
  with a note; `WriteNote` for check hashes / SU+J.
- **Mount:** kernel method, `--options [ro,]ufstype=X`. Read/write only with **Tools > Allow UFS writes (experimental)**
  (`AppSettings.UfsWrite`) and a `ufs` module with `modinfo -F wsl_handoff` = 1 (`FsSupport.CanWriteUfs`). New for every
  kernel mount asked rw: `/proc/mounts` is checked and a driver's ro fallback is recorded (no flush on eject).
- **Build script:** `ufs` in the default set, `UFS_FS=m` + `UFS_FS_WRITE=y` (stamp `... ufs` → one reconfigure),
  `ufs_handoff` patches a copy of fs/ufs: fs_clean 0 while rw, 1 on clean unmount, 0 (not 0xff) on error; clears
  FS_METACKHASH; sets fs_mtime with SU+J; rw only when fs_clean == 1. Falls back to a read-only build if an anchor moves.
- **Docs:** README (table, build steps, UFS section), all 10 distro guides (tables, driver sections, troubleshooting;
  Debian/Kali anchors renamed), CLAUDE.md.
- **Files.** `src/Core/FileSystems.cs`, `src/Core/MountManager.cs`, `src/Core/Models.cs`, `src/Core/StateStore.cs`,

## ⭐ 369d3ff — **THE SPLITTER CAN BE SEEN, AND THE LOG STARTS BIG: THE UPPER PANE AT HALF ITS OLD HEIGHT.** _2026-09-24. Evidence: the user ran `a0d162d` at 16:26 — the log shows X → tray (16:27:00, `exit requested False`) and Close → exit (16:27:03, `True`) working — but `state.json` kept `LogHeight: 0`: the splitter was never dragged. It was an unmarked 6 px strip in the window colour. User: "vertically resize the upper and lower panes; the upper pane initially 50% smaller, the lower gets the extra space". `dotnet build -c Release`: succeeded. **Not yet run.**_

- **Visible splitter:** 8 px (96 dpi), a line along each edge and nine grip dots in the middle (`OnPaintSplitter`,
  repainted on move and resize); tooltip "Drag to resize the drive list and the log." over the bar.
- **Default split:** the drive list + buttons get half of what a 170 px log left them; the log gets the rest (about
  190 / 360 px in the default 1100 × 680 window). A dragged height (`LogHeight` > 0) still wins.
- **Files.** `src/UI/MainForm.cs`.

---

## ⭐ a0d162d — **MAIN WINDOW: DRAGGABLE SPLITTER, X MINIMIZES TO THE TRAY, CLOSE BUTTON EXITS.** _2026-09-24. Evidence: user request ("both upper and lower panes resizeable", "the top right x also minimizes the window, not closes", "add a Close button on the bottom right"). `dotnet build -c Release`: succeeded, 0 warnings. **Not yet run** (needs an elevated session)._

- **SplitContainer** between the drive list (+ button bar) and the log; `FixedPanel = Panel2`, minimums 140 / 60 px at
  96 dpi, default log 170 px. `ApplySplitLayout()` in `OnLoad` (fires on first show, also when started in the tray).
- **`AppSettings.LogHeight`** (96-dpi px, 0 = default), saved only after a user drag (`SplitterMoving` flag).
- **X / Alt+F4 / taskbar close → minimize to the tray** (`OnFormClosing`, `CloseReason.UserClosing` without
  `exitRequested`). First-hide balloon mentions tray > Exit.
- **Close button** (bottom right, `Dock = Right` host panel) and tray **Exit** → `RequestExit()` → the existing close
  path with its job and mounted-drive prompts. The other buttons wrap to a second row on narrow windows (bar height
  follows `GetPreferredSize`).

## ⭐ 876d770 — **FILESYSTEM DRIVERS BUILD WITH APT TOO; TESTED ON KALI.** _2026-09-24 11:07. Evidence: Kali 2026.2 on kernel 6.18.33.2 — full apt build, 3 probes pinned, CRCs match, all 6 modules load, JFS / APFS / ZFS loop-device tests pass, restore after a simulated restart with all built modules unloaded works. Tumbleweed zypper path re-checked (jfs-only rebuild)._

- `build-wsl-modules.sh`: `pkg_install ZYPPER -- APT` names; ZFS version from `dpkg-query zfsutils-linux` (no recommends,
  so no zfs-dkms); gcc-NN from the distro; ZFS skipped with a message when the distro's OpenZFS is older than the kernel
  (META `Linux-Maximum`) instead of failing the run.
- App hints mention apt distros. Guides: Kali (APFS through the built kernel driver, Kali's fsapfsmount has no FUSE;
  removing Kali), Debian (contrib for ZFS), Ubuntu (24.04 ZFS too old), DKMS explained.

## be5a3b8 — **DISTRO GUIDES: FILESYSTEMS REPOSITORY FOR LEAP AND SLES.** _2026-09-24 10:29. Evidence: download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems has Leap 16.0, 15.7 and SLE_15_SP6 builds of zfs, jfsutils, apfsprogs; gcc13 is in Leap/SLES repositories. **Driver build on Leap/SLES untested.**_

- Leap and SLES guides: the repository, ZFS, the driver build. Other distros told they need an openSUSE / SLES (later:
  apt) distro for the build. Built drivers survive WSL restarts.

## ⭐⭐ 9ea658f — **DRIVER BUILD FIXED ON 6.18; BUILT DRIVERS SURVIVE WSL RESTARTS.** _2026-09-24 10:29. Evidence: after `wsl --update` to 6.18.33.2 nothing installed — GCC 13.5 vs Microsoft's 13.2.0 turned `__cold` on through CC_HAS_SANE_FUNCTION_ALIGNMENT and changed the CRCs of `_printk`, `panic`, `__fortify_panic`; and the 6.6 modules had vanished because `/lib/modules/<release>` is an overlay whose upper layer is in the VM. Verified: 608/608 btrfs.ko CRCs match; jfs, hfs, hfsplus, spl, zfs, apfs load; loop-device tests pass; restore after a simulated restart works._

- `pin_kconfig`: every toolchain probe that differs from `/proc/config.gz` is pinned, then `olddefconfig` again.
- Modules kept in `/var/lib/wsl-modules/<release>`, copied to `/lib/modules/<release>/extra` + depmod;
  `FsSupport.RestoreModules` before the support check and every module load.
- devel:gcc Factory fallback on Tumbleweed only.

## f4c480d — **DISTRO SETUP GUIDES; REISERFS SKIPPED ON 6.13+ KERNELS.** _2026-09-24 09:56. Evidence: WSL kernel now 6.18.33.2; ReiserFS was removed in Linux 6.13 (no `fs/reiserfs`), so the build failed there._

- `docs/distros/`: guides for Tumbleweed, Leap, SLES, Ubuntu, Fedora, Kali, Debian, CentOS Stream / AlmaLinux, Arch.
- Build script skips ReiserFS without `fs/reiserfs`; stops early without zypper. App hints corrected (ReiserFS on 6.13+,
  fsapfsmount availability). README install step copies `tools\` and `LICENSE`.

## ⭐⭐⭐ fb07a19 — **MULTI-FILESYSTEM SUPPORT, WSL DRIVER BUILDS, LOGGING, LICENSING.** _2026-09-24 00:11. Evidence: the first launch on Windows failed with a side-by-side configuration error — `--` inside an XML comment in app.manifest. 6.6.87.2: all 7 built modules loaded; JFS rw + fsck clean; APFS kernel ro / readwrite + fsck.apfs clean; ZFS pool on a loop device imported by GUID under /mnt/wsl._

- Manifest fix; console front end `BtrfsUsbMounter.com` (terminals wait, real exit code).
- DEBUG log level, startup header, every wsl.exe call numbered; Tools toggle and `--verbose`.
- Detection of btrfs, ext2/3/4, XFS, JFS, ReiserFS, Reiser4, ZFS, HFS+, APFS; runtime kernel support check.
- ext/XFS rw; APFS ro (fsapfsmount) or kernel driver (writes experimental, opt-in); ZFS through `zpool import/export`.
- `tools/build-wsl-modules.sh` with symbol-version check; Tools > Build filesystem drivers.

## bdce371 — **INITIAL COMMIT: BTRFS USB MOUNTER.** _2026-09-23 20:36. Evidence: 32 core tests under Mono (superblock parser on a real btrfs image, output parsers, quoting, PowerShell-format state.json, flush command, cancel / timeout, job queue)._

- WinForms (.NET Framework 4.8) tool mounting btrfs USB drives through WSL2: tray UI, drive info, scrub, safe eject.
